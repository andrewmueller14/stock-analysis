# stock-analysis/VBA-Challenge


##Purpose
The purpose of stock market analysis is to loop all code through a data set in a single macro. We refactor to clean up the messier code that was initially used to run 
the dataset. We clean the data because it is easier for others to read and edit, which is important when more than one person is editing the code.
We will also compare run time speed to see if refactoring affects computer performance versus our inital code.

##Results
 The initial script used on the data was broken up into more than one macro, while the refactored program was in a single macro.  Suprisingly, the refactored code
 ran the script slower than the initial code, shown below.
